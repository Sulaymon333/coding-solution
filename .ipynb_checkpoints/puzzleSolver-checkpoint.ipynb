    "The problem involves rearranging a set of puzzle pieces, represented as strings, to form a complete image of a rectangular puzzle of arbitrary size. The input to the program is a text file, which starts with the number of pieces as an integer, followed by the puzzle pieces, one piece per line, in arbitrary order. The output should be the number of unique solutions that can be formed by rearranging the puzzle pieces.\n",

    "### More details\n",
    "Consider the puzzle has 20 pieces for example and shape of each piece is defined by four characters defining each side, with possible values for the piece: S = straight I = Indent O = Outdent. The description of each piece always starts from the north ( = up) side, then east ( = right), then south ( = down) and finally west (= left) side of the piece. The piece in the top left corner in the puzzle above would be described as SOIS using this scheme. No piece in the puzzle can be flipped or rotated. The program will determine the number of unique solutions to the puzzle ( = permutations). No colour information is handled in this problem, but a unique colour can be assumed for each piece so that if two identical pieces swap places, it results in a new solution to the puzzle. "

    "To solve this problem, we will use a backtrack algorithm, which is a well-known algorithm for solving combinatorial problems. The backtrack algorithm works by systematically trying different combinations of solutions and backtracking when a solution cannot be found. In this case, we will use the backtrack algorithm to find all the unique solutions that can be formed by rearranging the puzzle pieces.\n",

    "1. **Reading the Puzzle Pieces:** the first step is to read the input file and extract the puzzle pieces. This can be done by reading the first line of the file, which contains the number of pieces, and then reading the subsequent lines, which contain the puzzle pieces. The puzzle pieces can be stored in a list or an array for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rearranging Puzzle Pieces using Backtrack Algorithm:** once the puzzle pieces have been extracted, we can use the backtrack algorithm to rearrange them to form the original image. The algorithm starts by choosing a piece and trying to place it in different positions in the puzzle. If the piece can be placed in a position, the algorithm moves on to the next piece and repeats the process. If the piece cannot be placed in any position, the algorithm backtracks to the previous piece and tries a different position for it. This process continues until a solution is found or all possibilities have been exhausted. We can keep track of all the unique solutions found by using a set or a hash table to store the solutions."
