The input to the program is a text file, which starts with the number of pieces as an integer, followed by the puzzle pieces, one piece per line, in arbitrary order. The output should be the number of unique solutions that can be formed by rearranging the puzzle pieces.\n",

    "Consider the puzzle has 20 pieces for example and shape of each piece is defined by four characters defining each side, with possible values for the piece: S = straight I = Indent O = Outdent. The description of each piece always starts from the north ( = up) side, then east ( = right), then south ( = down) and finally west (= left) side of the piece. The piece in the top left corner in the puzzle above would be described as SOIS using this scheme. No piece in the puzzle can be flipped or rotated. The program will determine the number of unique solutions to the puzzle ( = permutations). No colour information is handled in this problem, but a unique colour can be assumed for each piece so that if two identical pieces swap places, it results in a new solution to the puzzle. "

    "To solve this problem, we will use a backtrack algorithm, which is a well-known algorithm for solving combinatorial problems.

In this case, we will use the backtrack algorithm to find all the unique solutions that can be formed by rearranging the puzzle pieces.\n",

The puzzle pieces can be stored in a list or an array for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rearranging Puzzle Pieces using Backtrack Algorithm:** once the puzzle pieces have been extracted, we can use the backtrack algorithm to rearrange them to form the original image. The algorithm starts by choosing a piece and trying to place it in different positions in the puzzle. If the piece can be placed in a position, the algorithm moves on to the next piece and repeats the process. If the piece cannot be placed in any position, the algorithm backtracks to the previous piece and tries a different position for it. This process continues until a solution is found or all possibilities have been exhausted. We can keep track of all the unique solutions found by using a set or a hash table to store the solutions."

    "The code above is a solution to the puzzle where given a set of pieces represnted by string pieces and the number of pieces, it tries to find the number of unique solutions possible to fit the pieces into a 4x(n/4) grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading in the file and getting the number of piece and the string of each piece. this section of the solution is then implemneted. The results from reading the file is used in this solution as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is divided into three functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `is_valid_placement` function - This function takes a puzzle, a row, a column, and a piece, and checks if the piece can be placed in the current position in the puzzle. It checks if the north side of the piece matches the south side of the piece above it and if the west side of the piece matches the east side of the piece to the left of it. If both conditions are satisfied, it returns True, else False. This is considered for pieces that are not at the edge of the puzzle.\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `solve_puzzle function` - This is the main function that implements the backtracking algorithm to find the solutions to the puzzle. It takes the puzzle, current row and column, a list to keep track of the used pieces, and a set to store all the unique solutions. The function first checks if the row and col parameters are equal to the length of the puzzle, and col is 0. If both conditions are satisfied, it means all pieces have been placed and a solution has been found, and the puzzle is added to the set of solutions. The function then checks if col is equal to the length of the puzzle column. If this is true, it means the end of a row has been reached, so the row is incremented, and the function is called again. <br/> <br/>Finally, the function loops through all the pieces and checks if each piece has been used already. If not, it checks if the piece is a valid placement in the current position by calling the is_valid_placement function. If the placement is valid, the piece is placed, the used_pieces list is updated, and the function is called again. Once the function returns, the piece is removed, the used_pieces list is updated again, and the loop continues until all pieces have been tried for that position.\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `find_solutions` function - This function is primarily meant to help test the solution. it takes the number of pieces and the pieces (arry of strings) as input, initializes the puzzle, used_pieces list, and solutions set, and calls the solve_puzzle function to find all the solutions. Finally, it returns the number of solutions in the set.<br/><br/>At the last part of the solution, some input sample read from the file is provided to the function and the number of unique solutions is printed."
