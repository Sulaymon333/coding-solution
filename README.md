# PUZZLE SOLVER ALGORITHM SOLUTION

This is a solution to a coding assignment that involves solving a jigsaw puzzle. This solution will use python and might explore a number of graph traversal Algorithms such as Backtracking (brute force), Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithms to create a puzzle_solver() program.

## Notebook setup

After the notebook has finished loading, follow the steps below to run the notebook:

1. Click `Kernel` button above
2. Select `Restart & Run All`to see the output of each cell all at once
3. Select `Restart and Clear output`to clear the output of all the cells at once
4. In case you run a cell individually, make sure you run all the cells above it that contains variables reference in that particular cell.

### TODOs

1. Implement a valid solution that return expected result. The current result do not match the expected result
2. Handle different edge cases mentioned in the document as part of the code implementation
3. Build different test cases for the highlighted edge cases mentioned on the document
4. Implement Depth-First Search Algorithm for the same problem
5. Implement Bread-First Search Algorithm for the same problem
6. If possible, implement A\* Algorithm for the same problem
